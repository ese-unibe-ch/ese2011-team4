CalPal v1.0
Please read the following descriptions, before using CalPal!

==Description==
	What is CalPal? CalPal is an calendar application
	which helps you to plan your day,week, month and year.
	Basicly it is a calendar, which is able to save
	events which occur in your life.
	CalPal is not just a simple calendar app, which
	can just save events, it can do a lot more!
	The Program has following features:
		* Register yourself on the page
		* Save events (with a description, starting/ending date, location 
			(is also shown on Google Maps), privacy, location and of course a name)
		* Edit events
		* Add locations (if there is a conflict with them, you get warned)
		* Repeat events (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or any other period, you prefer)
		* Save events from other users, into your calendar (Note: If the creator of the 
			event deletes or edits it, the result will be also in your calendar!)
		* Comment on events of other users
		* See, who joined which calendar
		* Add users to your favorite list (makes easier to follow other users)
		* Search for users by name and e-mail, calendars and events
		* Collision of events will be shown (timeoverlapping with two or more events)
		* Print out the whole calendar or just the event, you want
		* Reminder, which reminds you of events via e-mail
		* A complete user profile (user can decide whether everything is public or not)

==Installation==
	There are no special things to do. Just copy all files in ONE folder.
	Do not rename anything in these folders! The folder calendar and the 
	Play! files have to be in the same folder otherwise you can not 
	start CalPal!

==How to run CalPal?==
	Since CalPal runs with the play! framework (see link below), 
	you have to run this application via command-lines. So you have to open up the os specific 
	prompt and switch to the folder, where the application is in (e.g. if your folder is
	C:\Users\Username\CalPal you type in cd users/username/calpal). Now you can run the application
	with the following command: play run calendar. There should be a tex like this:
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	C:\Users\Username\CalPal>play run calendar
	~        _            _
	~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |
	~ | '_ \| |/ _' | || |_|
	~ |  __/|_|\____|\__ (_)
	~ |_|            |__/

	Here you can see that the program is waiting on port 9000.
	So open up your webbrowser and go to the following site: localhost:9000
	You should see the login page of CalPal and the promp window should show this:
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	16:57:14,928 INFO  ~ Application 'calendar' is now started !
	16:57:15,101 INFO  ~ Loading intial data
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Now you can register on the page or use our provided demo data (below), to login.
	After registration you get back to the login page.
	
==Test CalPal==
	If you have logged in successfully, you can test the application.
	You get redirected to a list of all your calendars (if you did not use the
	demo data, you will not have any). Here you can see your favorites and your
	actions. You can add a new calendar, add a new location, edit your profile or
	search for other users, calendars and events.
	You have also the ability to see all Users and Locations by clicking on one
	link in the upper navigation bar.
